          <h2>2014 U.S. State Data Analysis</h2>
          <p>The chart allows to implement the visualization of multiple variables </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Independent variables: % Poverty or Age (Median) or household income (median)</li>
              <li>Dependent variables: % obese population or % of smokers or % of the population without healthcare insurance</li>
            </ul>
          <p>The data is presented grouped by states. Please select the axes categories you want to compare. You can hover over 
            the state markers and the chart will show the values that they represent.</p>
          <p>The comparison of the three dependent variables vs. median household income shows some interesting trends</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Both % of obesity and % of smokers seems to be higher in states with lower median household income in comparison 
              to states with higher income. The linear correlation coefficient are in the rage of 0.65-0.66, the highest values of 
              the 3-comparison.</li>
            <li>The % of uninsured population does not show an evident trend. States with lower household income shows relatively low
              % of insured population (likely due the Medicaid program). On the other, Massachussetts has the lower % of insured 
              population. This might be related to the exitence of state-level program similar to the Affordable Care Act (ACA or theso-called 
              Obama care) scope since 2006. Texas shows the higher % of uninsured population. After the implementation of the ACA, the state
              goverment did not expand the Medicad program target to the lower income population

              Other state slike Georgia and Mississippi also have not enacted the Medicaid expansion</i>
            <li>The data we are showing is from 2014. Some states information have changed. For example, Loisiana reported about 8% of insured population in 2019 mainly due to reduced poverty
              percentage and extension of the Medicaid program by the state government
              <a href=https://www.businessreport.com/newsletters/number-of-insured-in-louisiana-goes-up-but-so-too-does-poverty-number/>(please click here to see source).</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The trends of the comparison of the 3 dependent variables vs. the % of poverty will reflect the trends that we just mentioned for
            household income. States with lower % of poverty (therefore, higher median income) will show higher % of obesity and smokers
          </p>
          <p>The comparison of the 3 dependent variables vs. age median does not show major evident patterns. The % of uninsured population seems to be
          mainly between 34 to 40 years. When selecting the % of smokers, Utah has the younger population and shows the lowest percentage of smokers, likely 
          related to the high % of people professing the Mormon religion <a href=https://news.gallup.com/poll/167771/smoking-rate-lowest-utah-highest-kentucky.aspx>(please click here to see source)</a>
